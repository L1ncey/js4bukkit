Experimental Project: Use JavaScript for Bukkit Plugin Development.

It is still actively under development. This is an experimental project, and we do not recommend using it in a production environment until a stable version is released.

## Overview

Welcome to **js4bukkit**, an innovative project enabling Bukkit plugin development using the expressive power of
JavaScript.

This framework allows developers to craft feature-rich plugins, including event listeners, commands, and Placeholder API
compatibilityâ€”all in the elegant syntax of JavaScript.

Please note that js4bukkit is currently in active development, and while it promises a dynamic and flexible approach to
plugin development, it's recommended for experimental use and not yet suitable for production environments.

## Features

While js4bukkit is still in its early stages of development, here are some of the planned features that will be
implemented in future releases:

- **JavaScript-First Development**: Unleash the capabilities of JavaScript for crafting Bukkit plugins effortlessly.

- **External dependencies loading**: You can easily invoke third-party libraries by placing the JAR files or directly providing 
  Maven dependencies; they will be automatically resolved.

- **Event Listeners**: Define responsive event listeners using JavaScript to handle a variety of in-game events.

- **Easy Event Listener Concept**: Introducing the concept of Easy Event Listener, an experimental approach optimizing
  listener creation for repeated events. This encourages modularity and prevents code accumulation.

- **Command Integration**: Implement custom commands seamlessly using JavaScript to elevate server functionality.

- **Placeholder API Harmony**: Effortlessly integrate with Placeholder API for dynamic information display within
  messages.

- **Plugin Lifecycle Management**: Implement features for better control over plugin activation, deactivation, and
  reloading.


- **_Enhanced Scripting API_**: Expand the available scripting API to cover a broader range of Bukkit functionalities.

- **_Advanced Configuration Options_**: Provide more flexibility in configuring and customizing plugin behavior.

- **_Documentation Enrichment_**: Continuously improve and expand the documentation to assist developers in utilizing the
  full potential of js4bukkit.

**_Italic indicates to-do items; we will update these features soon._**

## Disclaimer

js4bukkit is an experimental project with many planned features yet to be implemented. Use it cautiously, and avoid
deployment in production environments until it reaches a stable release.
