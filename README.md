Experimental Project: Use JavaScript for Bukkit Plugin Development

## Overview

Welcome to **js4bukkit**, an innovative project enabling Bukkit plugin development using the expressive power of JavaScript.

This framework allows developers to craft feature-rich plugins, including event listeners, commands, and Placeholder API compatibility—all in the elegant syntax of JavaScript.

Please note that js4bukkit is currently in active development, and while it promises a dynamic and flexible approach to plugin development, it's recommended for experimental use and not yet suitable for production environments.

## Planned Features

While js4bukkit is still in its early stages of development, here are some of the planned features that will be implemented in future releases:

- **JavaScript-First** Development: Unleash the capabilities of JavaScript for crafting Bukkit plugins effortlessly.
- **Event Listeners**: Define responsive event listeners using JavaScript to handle a variety of in-game events.
- **Easy Event Listener Concept**: Introducing the concept of Easy Event Listener, an experimental approach optimizing listener creation for repeated events. This encourages modularity and prevents code accumulation.
- **Command Integration**: Implement custom commands seamlessly using JavaScript to elevate server functionality.
- **Placeholder API Harmony**: Effortlessly integrate with Placeholder API for dynamic information display within messages.
- **Advanced Configuration Options**: Provide more flexibility in configuring and customizing plugin behavior.
- **Enhanced Scripting API**: Expand the available scripting API to cover a broader range of Bukkit functionalities.
- **Plugin Lifecycle Management**: Implement features for better control over plugin activation, deactivation, and reloading.
- **Documentation Enrichment**: Continuously improve and expand the documentation to assist developers in utilizing the full potential of js4bukkit.

## Disclaimer

js4bukkit is an experimental project with many planned features yet to be implemented. Use it cautiously, and avoid deployment in production environments until it reaches a stable release.
